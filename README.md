# Sepsis-Detection
Developed an ML pipeline for early sepsis detection in ICU patients using clinical data from Kaggle. Implemented a TabNet deep learning model trained on GPU with Optuna hyperparameter tuning, achieving AUC-ROC of 0.91 and accuracy of 84.6%. Explored integrating TabNet with LSTM architectures for modeling temporal medical data and improving early warning systems.
